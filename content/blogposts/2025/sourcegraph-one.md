Today we're announcing Sourcegraph One, a new release of Sourcegraph
that provides a new UI for searching, grokking, and creating code, a
new API for developers to build agentic automations that target the
greatest sources of toil in the SDLC, and a new underlying engine that
combines the pattern matching abilities of LLMs with a precise
knowledge graph of code and technical context.

{/*
Sourcegraph One combines the world's best LLMs with the most
precise and universal index of code and technical knowledge and
integrations into the long tail of enterprise editors, code hosts,
context sources, and dev tools.

The future of coding will synthesize human creativity with the
pattern-matching abilities of AI and structured databases of code and
technical documents. The gateway to these capabilities is an
experimental new UI that merges the key elements of GUIs and TUIs: the
omnibox.

## Introducing omnibox

Sourcegraph One introduces a new agentic command prompt for searching,
grokking, creating, and transforming code: the omnibox. The omnibox is
an input box that follows you throughout the SDLC, whether you're in
the editor or outside of it. It incorporates builtin capabilities like
code search, LLM-based chat, and code-grokking agents, but is also
designed to be extensible by developers to fit into the context of
specific organizations and enterprises.
